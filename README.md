# [Bitcoin Patrol](https://bitcoin-patrol.com)

A website that displays a graph of bitcoin prices and allows users to set notifications for different thresholds. 

## ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ In Progress! ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§
Currently learning **React** with **TypeScript** and **node.js** library **Axios**. 

### Design

The frontend of the website should show a live graph of the bitcoin price along with additional statistics. It would be a **huge** plus to get this graph interactive. To achieve this, I will call on the free API from [coinbase](https://developers.coinbase.com/) or something like [polygon](https://polygon.io). The website would have to continuously make these API calls to get up-to-date data. This data could then be stored in **redis/memcached**. For an interactive thing, perhaps embedding a gadget like Tableau would be the way to go, but that is a nice-to-have far down the road.

The website should start with basic functionality to enter an email address and a bitcoin price threshold. The first task is to set up a lambda function that gets triggered and sends a confirmation email to the user. The next task is to store the information in a sorted list to keep track of it. Then, when the bitcoin price crosses a certain threshold, a second lambda should be triggered that sends an email to the user. The AWS components neccesary here would be **lambda**, **SNS**, and **Api Gateway**.

### CI/CD

A major goal of mine during this project is to use strong programming principles. To that end, I spent a ton of time setting up CI/CD pipelines using [Buddy](https://app.buddy.works/). One pipeline governs the AWS architecture cdk app while the other pipeline is for the react app.

**React Pipeline**

  - [ ] Builds the project.
  - [ ] Uploads the files to Amazon S3.
  - [ ] Purges the AWS Cloudfront cache. 

**AWS Infrastructure Pipeline**

  - [ ] Builds the project, installing the aws cli and aws cdk.
  - [ ] Executes **cdk deploy** on all cdk stacks.

Special thanks to the [tutorial](https://medium.com/avmconsulting-blog/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-on-aws-using-the-aws-cdk-d7970033950f) that got me started on this process.

### Motivation 

  - Practice developing infrastructure-as-code through the **AWS CDK**. Provisioned resources include **S3**, **CloudFront**, **route53**, **Lambda**, and **Api Gateway**!
  - Learn **React** with **TypeScript**.
  - Demonstrate strong software engineering techniques.
